NiaAML's documentation!
==================================

.. automodule:: niaaml

NiaAML is an automated machine learning Python framework based on nature-inspired algorithms for optimization. The name comes from the automated machine learning method of the same name [1]. Its goal is to efficiently compose the best possible classification pipeline for the given task using components on the input. The components are divided into three groups: feature seletion algorithms, feature transformation algorithms and classifiers. The framework uses nature-inspired algorithms for optimization to choose the best set of components for the classification pipeline on the output and optimize their parameters. We use `NiaPy framework <https://github.com/NiaOrg/NiaPy>`_  for the optimization process which is a popular Python collection of nature-inspired algorithms. The NiaAML framework is easy to use and customize or expand to suit your needs.
